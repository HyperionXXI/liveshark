\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Scope.} LiveShark is a \textbf{passive} analyzer for show-control networking (Art-Net, sACN). It focuses on
\textbf{offline PCAP analysis} with \textbf{DMX frame reconstruction}, \textbf{automatic conflict detection},
and \textbf{reproducible reports}.\\
\textbf{Audience.} Designed to be readable by \textbf{non-software specialists} (lighting technicians, integrators, QA).

\section{Terminology and conventions}

\subsection{Authoritative version and translation policy}
\textbf{Authoritative version (prevails).} The English specification in \texttt{spec/en} is the \emph{authoritative}
version: in case of discrepancy or incomplete translation, \textbf{the English version prevails}.\\
\textbf{Best-effort translation.} A French translation may exist in \texttt{spec/fr}. It is provided as a convenience and
\textbf{may lag behind}. When differences exist, the authoritative version prevails.

\subsection{Normative keywords}
The key words \MUST, \MUSTNOT, \SHOULD, \SHOULDNOT, and \MAY are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
(RFC 2119 and RFC 8174). Only \textbf{UPPERCASE} usage is normative.


\subsection{Term note: \enquote{Live}}
In the project name, \enquote{Live} refers to \textbf{live entertainment / show control} (lighting networks), not to a guarantee
of real-time capture capability. Real-time capture is optional and may be introduced in later releases.

\subsection{Core terms}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}l X@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Term} & \textbf{Meaning} \\
\midrule
Packet & Network packet as captured in PCAP/PCAPNG. \\
Protocol message & Decoded application-layer unit (e.g., ArtDMX, sACN Data Packet). \\
DMX frame & Reconstructed DMX512 state (512 slots) for a universe at a given time. \\
Universe & Logical group of up to 512 DMX slots. \\
Source & Emitter identified by IP and, if applicable, protocol identity (e.g., sACN CID). \\
Flow & Unidirectional tuple (proto, src ip:port, dst ip:port). \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Acronyms}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}l X@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Acronym} & \textbf{Expanded form} \\
\midrule
DMX & Digital Multiplex (DMX512 / DMX512-A) \\
sACN & Streaming ACN (ANSI E1.31) \\
CID & Component Identifier (sACN source identifier) \\
PCAP & Packet Capture file format \\
FPS / PPS / BPS & Frames / Packets / Bytes per second \\
DoD & Definition of Done \\
\bottomrule

\section{What LiveShark is (and is not)}

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Offline analysis of PCAP/PCAPNG for Art-Net and sACN.
  \item DMX frame reconstruction (512 slots) and metrics (fps, pps/bps, jitter).
  \item Automatic detection of \textbf{conflicts} (multiple sources on same universe with overlap).
  \item Versioned, reproducible JSON reports for tickets, post-mortem, QA and CI.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Capture input (no Wireshark required).}
LiveShark \MUSTNOT{} require the Wireshark GUI application to operate.
For v0.1, captures are provided as PCAP/PCAPNG files produced by standard tools (e.g., \texttt{tcpdump} on Linux, \texttt{pktmon} on Windows, or any capture tool that exports PCAP/PCAPNG).
Live capture is a future objective and \MAY{} be added later via libpcap/Npcap (without changing the report schema).



\subsection{Offline-first strategy (product intent)}
LiveShark is designed as an \emph{offline-first} analyzer: early releases focus on post-mortem analysis of PCAP/PCAPNG captures
to maximize robustness, reproducibility, and ease of support. This is a deliberate engineering strategy, not a product limitation.
Live capture / online analysis is an explicit future objective and \MAY{} be implemented once the offline core is validated.

\textbf{Forward compatibility.} The core analysis pipeline \MUST{} be architected so that packet input can come from either:
(a) a file reader (PCAP/PCAPNG), or (b) a live capture source (future). No offline-only assumption \MUST{} be embedded in the
domain model (frames, conflicts, reports).



\subsection{Non-goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item LiveShark is \textbf{not} a general-purpose packet analyzer (it does not replace Wireshark).
  \item LiveShark is \textbf{passive} by design: it does not transmit or inject traffic.
  \item ``Laser over IP'' starts as \textbf{generic UDP flow metrics only}; laser frame reconstruction is out of scope for v0.1.
\end{itemize}

\section{Metrics (defaults)}
Unless otherwise stated:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{pps/bps window:} 1.0 s sliding window
  \item \textbf{fps window:} 5.0 s sliding window
  \item \textbf{jitter window:} 10.0 s sliding window (see metrics definition; concept reference: RFC 3550)
\end{itemize}

\section{Contractual requirements (extract)}
This document is a bootstrap spec: requirements are intentionally minimal at project start.


\begin{reqbox}{LS-ARCH-001}{P0}{}
The core \MUST{} expose a packet/event input abstraction so that analysis can be driven by:
(a) a PCAP/PCAPNG file reader (v0.1), and (b) a live capture source (future), without changing the domain model or report schema.
\end{reqbox}

\begin{reqbox}{LS-PROD-001}{P0}{}
LiveShark \MUSTNOT{} require the Wireshark GUI application. It \MUST{} accept PCAP/PCAPNG files produced by standard capture tools.
\end{reqbox}



\begin{reqbox}{LS-FR-001}{P0}{}
LiveShark \MUST ingest PCAP/PCAPNG files and enumerate UDP flows.
\end{reqbox}

\begin{reqbox}{LS-FR-010}{P0}{}
LiveShark \MUST decode Art-Net ArtDMX and reconstruct DMX frames (512 slots) per universe.
\end{reqbox}

\begin{reqbox}{LS-FR-011}{P0}{}
LiveShark \MUST decode sACN (E1.31) DMX data packets and reconstruct DMX frames per universe.
\end{reqbox}

\begin{reqbox}{LS-CONF-001}{P1}{}
LiveShark \MUST detect concurrent sources: two or more sources emitting on the same universe with overlap $> 1.0$ s.
\end{reqbox}

\begin{reqbox}{LS-REP-001}{P1}{}
LiveShark \MUST generate a versioned JSON report containing at least: capture summary, universes, sources, flows, and conflicts.
\end{reqbox}
