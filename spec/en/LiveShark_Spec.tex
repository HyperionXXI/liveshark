\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Scope.} LiveShark is a \textbf{passive} analyzer for show-control networking (Art-Net, sACN). It focuses on
\textbf{offline PCAP analysis} with \textbf{DMX frame reconstruction}, \textbf{automatic conflict detection},
and \textbf{reproducible reports}.\\
\textbf{Audience.} Designed to be readable by \textbf{non-software specialists} (lighting technicians, integrators, QA).
Planned \textbf{follow mode} enables near-real-time analysis of a capture file that is still being written by an external tool.\\
The ideal user interface is a well-designed \textbf{GUI}; the \textbf{CLI} remains scriptable and produces the same report data.

\section{Terminology and conventions}

\subsection{Authoritative version and translation policy}
\textbf{Authoritative version (prevails).} The English specification in \texttt{spec/en} is the \emph{authoritative}
version: in case of discrepancy or incomplete translation, \textbf{the English version prevails}.\\
\textbf{French translation (informational).} A French translation may exist in \texttt{spec/fr}. It is provided as a convenience and
\textbf{may lag behind}. When differences exist, the authoritative version prevails.

\subsection{Normative keywords}
The key words \MUST, \MUSTNOT, \SHOULD, \SHOULDNOT, and \MAY{} are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
(RFC 2119 and RFC 8174). Only \textbf{UPPERCASE} usage is normative.

\subsection{Implementation language note}
LiveShark is implemented in \textbf{Rust} to balance \textbf{memory safety}, \textbf{performance}, and \textbf{cross-platform}
delivery (Windows, macOS, Linux) with a modern toolchain. This is an engineering choice for v0.1 and does not preclude
future components from using other languages where justified.
Rust code SHOULD follow the standard Rust style guide: \texttt{https://doc.rust-lang.org/style-guide/}.


\subsection{Term note: \enquote{Live}}
In the project name, \enquote{Live} refers to \textbf{live entertainment / show control} (lighting networks), not to a guarantee
of real-time capture capability. Real-time capture is optional and may be introduced in later releases.
Near-real-time diagnostic can be achieved via follow mode without requiring native live capture.

\section{What LiveShark is (and is not)}

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Offline analysis of PCAP/PCAPNG for Art-Net and sACN.
  \item DMX frame reconstruction (512 slots) and metrics (fps, pps/bps, jitter, loss, bursts).
  \item Automatic detection of \textbf{conflicts} (multiple sources on same universe with overlap).
  \item Versioned, reproducible JSON reports for tickets, post-mortem, QA and CI.
\end{itemize}
See Appendices A--D for the normative contracts (report, frames, conflicts, metrics).

\paragraph{Capture input (no Wireshark required).}
LiveShark \MUSTNOT{} require the Wireshark GUI\\ application to operate.
For v0.1, captures are provided as PCAP/PCAPNG files produced by standard tools (e.g., \texttt{tcpdump} on Linux,\\
\texttt{pktmon} on Windows, or any capture tool that exports PCAP/PCAPNG).
Live capture is a future objective and \MAY{} be added later via libpcap/Npcap (without changing the report schema).



\subsection{Offline-first strategy (product intent)}
LiveShark is designed as an \emph{offline-first} analyzer:\\
early releases focus on post-mortem analysis of PCAP/PCAPNG captures
to maximize robustness, reproducibility, and ease of support. This is a deliberate engineering strategy, not a product limitation.
Live capture / online analysis is an explicit future objective and \MAY{} be implemented once the offline core is validated.

\textbf{Forward compatibility.} The core analysis pipeline \MUST{} be architected so that packet input can come from either:
(a) a file reader (PCAP/PCAPNG), or (b) a live capture source (future). No offline-only assumption \MUST{} be embedded in the
domain model (frames, conflicts, reports).

Follow mode is the pragmatic path for reliable diagnostics during show preparation and during the show: it analyzes a capture
file as it grows, without requiring native capture on day one.

LiveShark may emit \emph{probable-cause hints} only as heuristics and separate from measured metrics. Any hint \MUST{} be
justified by observable indicators (loss patterns, jitter, bursts, timing asymmetries) and \MUSTNOT{} be presented as a certain
cause. Robust loss localization may require multiple capture points (for example, before and after a wireless segment) and is
reported only when feasible based on the available evidence.



\subsection{Non-goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item LiveShark is \textbf{not} a general-purpose packet analyzer (it does not replace Wireshark).
  \item LiveShark is \textbf{passive} by design: it does not transmit or inject traffic.
  \item ``Laser over IP'' starts as \textbf{generic UDP flow metrics only}; laser frame reconstruction is out of scope for v0.1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optional extensions (non-normative register)}
LiveShark is designed for diagnostics. Extensions must improve actionable diagnosis (loss, jitter, bursts, conflicts, multi-source) and must remain reproducible (same input $\rightarrow$ same output).
These candidates are non-normative and not part of the v0.1 scope.

Each extension declares its support level:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Flow level:} network-level metrics without payload semantics.
  \item \textbf{Message/Frame level:} structured decoding with a stable domain model.
\end{itemize}

LiveShark may emit \emph{probable-cause hints} only as heuristics. Such hints must be justified by observable patterns and must never be presented as certain causes.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{OSC (Message):} control-message timeline; correlation with DMX/network anomalies.
    \item \textbf{RTP-based protocols (Message):} sequence gaps, jitter, reordering; basis for health checks (e.g., AES67).
    \item \textbf{Network infrastructure (Flow):} IGMP/mDNS/DHCP/ARP/DNS patterns; multicast/discovery/addressing issues.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Architecture (conceptual)}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\linewidth}
\input{../common/figures/dataflow.tex}
\end{adjustbox}
\caption{Conceptual offline analysis pipeline (high level).}
\textit{Note:} The pipeline currently accepts (v0.1) only PCAP/PCAPNG files. Live capture input is a future objective (v0.3+),
aligned with the input abstraction requirement in P0.
\end{figure}

\section{Metrics (defaults)}
Unless otherwise stated:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{pps/bps window:} 1.0 s sliding window
  \item \textbf{fps window:} 5.0 s sliding window
  \item \textbf{jitter window:} 10.0 s sliding window (see metrics definition; concept reference: RFC 3550)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metrics definitions (minimal)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{pps/bps:} packets/bytes per second over a 1.0 s sliding window.
  \item \textbf{fps (universe):} reconstructed DMX frames per second over a 5.0 s sliding window.
  \item \textbf{jitter (IAT):} population standard deviation of inter-arrival time deltas over a 10.0 s sliding window (RFC 3550 \S6.4.1). Formula: $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum(\Delta_i - \mu)^2}$ with $\Delta_i = t_i - t_{i-1}$.
  \item \textbf{loss (observed):} when protocol sequence numbers exist (e.g., sACN), loss is reported as observed sequence gaps at the capture point. In v0.1, loss \MUST{} be reported only when sequence numbers exist; otherwise loss fields are omitted. This does not guarantee loss at the receiver.
\end{itemize}
See Appendix D for operational definitions and units.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Compliance percentage} is a placeholder (reported as 100.0) until a formal denominator is defined.
  \item \textbf{Conflict detection} uses time overlap only and may produce false positives when sources are active on different channels. The false-positive rate is not quantified in v0.1; conflicts are signals to investigate.

\subsection{Definition of Done v0.1}
The MVP is considered delivered if:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{liveshark pcap analyse --report out/report.json file.pcapng}\\
  runs successfully on 3 captures.
  \item Art-Net and sACN are decoded (universes, sources, fps).
  \item The JSON report contains \texttt{conflicts[]} (automatic detection).
  \item No crash occurs on truncated/corrupted PCAPs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Validation checklist (report contract)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Report includes \texttt{report\_version}, \texttt{tool}, \texttt{generated\_at}, \texttt{input}, and sections\\
  \texttt{capture\_summary}, \texttt{universes[]}, \texttt{flows[]}, \texttt{conflicts[]}, \texttt{compliance[]}.
  \item Deterministic ordering rules are applied (Appendix A).
  \item At least 4 golden tests: \texttt{artnet}, \texttt{artnet\_conflict}, \texttt{sacn}, \texttt{sacn\_conflict}.
  \item Volatile fields (\texttt{generated\_at}, and optionally \texttt{input.path}) are normalized in golden tests.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Golden tests}
Format: \texttt{tests/golden/<name>/\{input.pcapng, expected\_report.json,\\ metadata.toml\}}.
\texttt{metadata.toml} documents test intent, assertions (e.g., \texttt{fps\_min}, \texttt{compliance\_percentage}), and tolerance
rules. See \texttt{AGENTS.md} \S9.4 for the schema.

  "affected_channels": [],
  "severity": "medium",
  "conflict_score": 3.5
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Appendix B --- DMX frame reconstruction contract (v0.1)}
\subsubsection{Canonical DMX frame definition}
A reconstructed DMX frame is defined by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{universe}: 16-bit universe identifier.
  \item \textbf{timestamp}: capture time (packet timestamp).
  \item \textbf{source\_id}: stable source identity (see Appendix C).
  \item \textbf{protocol}: \texttt{artnet} or \texttt{sacn}.
  \item \textbf{slots[512]}: 512 DMX slot values (0--255).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Universe normalization}
The canonical universe is the 16-bit integer decoded from the protocol payload. For Art-Net, it is computed from the
ArtDMX \texttt{Net} (high byte) and \texttt{SubUni} (low byte) fields, with \texttt{universe\_id = 256 * net + subuni}
(0..32767). \texttt{Net} and \texttt{SubUni} are single-byte fields; \texttt{universe\_id} uses \texttt{Net} as the high byte
and \texttt{SubUni} as the low byte (not a little-endian 16-bit field). For sACN, it is the big-endian \texttt{universe}
field from the framing layer. The report uses this
canonical value; the same universe means identical numeric values across protocols.

\subsubsection{Minimal reconstruction rules}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Frames are reconstructed per universe, per source, and per protocol, using validated protocol payloads.
  \item Before the first observed frame for a given (universe, source, protocol), slot values default to 0.
  \item If a payload provides fewer than 512 slots, missing slots retain the last known value for that (universe, source, protocol).
  \item Reconstructed frames always expose 512 slots.
  \item Out-of-order frames are accepted; reconstruction and metrics are heuristic, without panic.
  \item FPS counts frames that pass protocol validation and are assigned to a universe.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Appendix C --- Conflict detection contract (v0.1)}
\subsubsection{Source identity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{sACN:} \texttt{sacn:cid:<CID>} when CID is present; otherwise fallback to \texttt{sacn:<ip>:<port>}.
  \item \textbf{Art-Net:} \texttt{artnet:<ip>:<port>}.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{CID format:} lowercase hexadecimal, 32 characters, no separators.

\subsubsection{Overlap definition}
Conflict is defined as: same universe, at least two sources, and overlap duration $> 1.0$ s.
Overlap is computed from the per-source time ranges \texttt{[first\_ts, last\_ts]} and the intersection duration.
In v0.1, conflict detection is a conservative approximation based on time overlap; any overlap $> 1.0$ s triggers a
conflict, even if sources do not actively compete on the same channels at the same time. The false-positive rate is not
quantified in v0.1; conflicts are signals to investigate. \texttt{affected\_channels[]} is best-effort and may be empty
when channel-level evidence cannot be derived from the overlap window.

\subsubsection{Conflict record fields}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{universe} (integer)
  \item \texttt{sources[]} (array of source identifiers)
  \item \texttt{overlap\_duration\_s} (float seconds)
  \item \texttt{affected\_channels[]} (array of integers; best-effort from overlap window, may be empty in v0.1)
  \item \texttt{severity} (string)
  \item \texttt{conflict\_score} (float)
\end{itemize}
In v0.1, \texttt{severity} is fixed to \texttt{"medium"} and \texttt{conflict\_score} equals \texttt{overlap\_duration\_s}.
Optional (planned, non-normative): \texttt{first\_seen}, \texttt{last\_seen}, and \texttt{protocols[]}.

\subsection{Appendix D --- Metric definitions (v0.1)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{pps/bps:} packets/bytes per second over a 1.0 s sliding window; units are packets/s and bytes/s. If windowed samples are unavailable, values are omitted.
  \item \textbf{fps (universe):} reconstructed DMX frames per second over a 5.0 s sliding window; unit is frames/s.
  \item \textbf{jitter (IAT):} population standard deviation of inter-arrival time deltas over a 10.0 s sliding window (RFC 3550 \S6.4.1). Unit is seconds (reported as ms where applicable). Formula: $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum(\Delta_i - \mu)^2}$ with $\Delta_i = t_i - t_{i-1}$.
  \item \textbf{loss (observed):} for sources with sequence numbers, loss is the sum of observed sequence gaps over a 10.0 s sliding window;\\
  \texttt{loss\_rate} is \texttt{loss\_packets / (loss\_packets + frames\_count)}\\
  for sequence-tracked frames. If sequence numbers are unavailable, loss fields \MUST{} be omitted.
  \item \textbf{bursts:} \texttt{burst\_count} is the number of loss bursts over a 10.0 s sliding window; \texttt{max\_burst\_len} is the
  maximum burst length observed in the same window.
\end{itemize}
