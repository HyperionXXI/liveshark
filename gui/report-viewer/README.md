# LiveShark Report Viewer (v0.1)

Open `index.html` in a modern browser and load a `report.json` file.

Notes:
- Absence is not zero: optional fields show as N/A when missing.
- Loss metrics are reported only when sequence numbers exist (sACN).
- Output lists are deterministic in the JSON; the UI can re-sort locally.
