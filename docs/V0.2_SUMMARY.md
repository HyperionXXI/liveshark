# v0.2 Summary (non-normative)

This short summary mirrors the planned scope in the EN specification.

- Viewer timeline: time-based navigation for universes, flows, and conflicts (read-only).
- Compare mode: side-by-side diff of two reports to highlight metric and conflict deltas.
- Performance focus: viewer stays responsive on large reports (table and details).
- Offline only: still file-based analysis, no native live capture.
- Schema stability: additive fields remain optional; no breaking changes for v0.1 consumers.
